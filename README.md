### Selected Topic 
We will analyze college football (CFB) data from several years to determine what defense a team should call based on past successes and failures. 

### Reasoning for Topic 
In football, good defense keeps the other team from scoring and provides a good field position, which allows the offense to start their drive-to-goal in a better position, thus allowing an easier time scoring. 

#### Data Source Description
We obtained reliable CFB data from the ESPN API, allowing us to analyze several years of data, which we have narrowed down to 6 years. Based on the amount of data we have, we believe these years are enough to accurately identify trends.
