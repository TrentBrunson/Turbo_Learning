## Project

### Selected Topic 
We will analyze college football (CFB) data from several years to determine what defense a team should call based on past successes and failures. 

### Reasoning for Topic 
In football, good defense keeps the other team from scoring and provides a good field position, which allows the offense to start their drive-to-goal in a better position, thus allowing an easier time scoring. 

### Data Source Description
We obtained reliable CFB data from the ESPN API, allowing us to analyze several years of data, which we have narrowed down to 6 years. Based on the amount of data we have, we believe these years are enough to accurately identify trends. 

### Question The Team Hopes To Answer:
After completing the project, we hope to be able to answer the following question: 
* What is the likelihood that the opposing team will call on a "run" or "pass" based on the play, distance or time?
* Are there any variables that have a greater affect on the decision call? If so, what are they?
